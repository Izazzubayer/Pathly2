Can't add outside the city once city is selected. [SOLVED]

- Doesnt show the activites / places around the same city. Doesn't understand. - Area specific grouping wihtin same proximity (be able to understand the context based on user data)
+ add destination with a + button on the trip basics page



Play with time and think of what can be done, like suggest the user if they should visit or not.
